## Instruction

- Target customers are **price sensitive** and especially responsive to discount pricing.  
- Segmentation should account for variability in bargain‑shopping behavior to distinguish true bargain shoppers from general customers.

## Rationale

- TravelTide’s large inventory enables sourcing the best deals to attract and retain bargain shoppers.  
- Aligning the exclusive discount perk with price‑sensitive segments leverages a competitive advantage and supports customer retention.
